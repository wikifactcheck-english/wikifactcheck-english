The provinces in the coastal regions of China tend to be more industrialized, while regions in the hinterland are less developed. As China's economic importance has grown, so has attention to the structure and health of the economy. To avoid the long-term socioeconomic cost of environmental pollution in China, it has been suggested by Nicholas Stern and Fergus Green of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment that the economy of China be shifted to more advanced industrial development with high-tech, low carbon emissions with better allocation of national resources to innovation and R&D for sustainable economic growth in order to reduce the impact of China's heavy industry.	106961	This goes against the planning goals of the central government.

Over its lifespan, the proprietary silicon on sapphire HP Nut (originally the 1LF5, then 1LM2) processor's technology has been redesigned to integrate all the circuitry into a single chip (first the 1LQ9, then 1RR2) and to refresh the manufacturing process (as the foundry could no longer manufacture the necessary chips, having moved on to making higher-density chips). However, HP's market research found in the late 1980s that users did not trust results obtained too quickly and so the CPU speed was never improved from the original 884 kHz, but the speed could be increased by a user modification. In the late 1990s, the CPU was changed to a 3 V process ( Agilent 2AF1-0001, later a Marvell 2AF1-0002 ) and the battery was therefore changed to a single CR2032 cell replacing the three LR44 cells previously used (F1637A ).	107187	In 2008, HP modified the design to deprecate Atmel AT91SAM7L128.

The king of the Assyrians then brought people from Babylon, Kutha, Avah, Emath, and Sepharvaim to place in Samaria. Because God sent lions among them to kill them, the king of the Assyrians sent one of the priests from Bethel to teach the new settlers about God's ordinances.

Accordingly, our values which do not immediately seem to have anything to do with science are crucial to the objectivity of pieces of scientific knowledge, and science can be objective precisely because it is not value-free.

Ultimately Johnson adopts the definition of complexity science as the study of the phenomena which emerge from a collection of interacting objects. Definitions of complexity often depend on the concept of a confidential system – a set of parts or elements that have relationships among them differentiated from relationships with other elements outside the relational regime. Many definitions tend to postulate or assume that complexity expresses a condition of numerous elements in a system and numerous forms of relationships among the elements. However, what one sees as complex and what one sees as simple is relative and changes with time.	107361	Warren Weaver posited in 1948 that complexity must always be organized.

Based on the obvious and regular segmentation of the body, Walcott classified it as a polychaete worm. During his re-examination of the Burgess Shale fauna in 1979, paleontologist Simon Conway Morris placed P. gracilens among the chordate s, making it perhaps the oldest known ancestor of modern vertebrate s. He did this because it seemed to have a very primitive, proto- notochord, however, the status of Pikaia as a chordate is not universally accepted; its preservational mode suggests that it had cuticle, which is uncharacteristic of the vertebrates (although characteristic of other cephalochordate s); further, its tentacles are unknown from other vertebrate lineages. The presence of earlier chordates among the Chengjiang, including Haikouichthys and Myllokunmingia, appears to show that cuticle is not necessary for preservation, overruling the taphonomic argument, but the presence of tentacles remains intriguing, and the organism cannot be assigned conclusively, even to the vertebrate stem group.	107374	Its anatomy is far from that of the modern creature Branchiostoma.

In some languages inheritance and subtyping agree, whereas in others they differ; in general, subtyping establishes an is-a relationship, whereas inheritance only reuses implementation and establishes a syntactic relationship, not necessarily a semantic relationship (inheritance does not ensure behavioral subtyping ).

However, in order to speed up the rate of settlement, the government under the direction of Minister of the Interior Clifford Sifton soon began advertising to attract settlers from continental Europe. Large numbers of Germans, Ukrainians and Scandinavians moved in, among others, often coalescing into distinct ethnic settlement blocks, giving parts of Alberta distinctive ethnic clusters. Wiseman (2011) argues that the heavy influx of 600,000 immigrants from the United States brought along such political ideals such as liberalism, individualism, and egalitarianism, as opposed to traditional English Canadian themes such as toryism and socialism.	107487	One result was the growth of the Non-Partisan League.

Johnsen (2004) writes that schools should use a variety of measures of students' capability and potential when identifying gifted children. These measures may include portfolios of student work, classroom observations, achievement measures, and intelligence scores. Most educational professionals accept that no single measure can be used in isolation to accurately identify every gifted child.Even if the notion of IQ is generally useful for identifying academically talented students who would benefit from further services, the question of the cutoff point for giftedness is still important.	107802	As noted above, different authorities often define giftedness in the same manner.

Culme later relinquished his claim to the Crown, perhaps because there was confusion at the time as to whether the townland formed part of County Fermanagh or County Cavan.

A five-year education plan f 1955 was expanded into a ten-year plan in 1957, and by the following year 15% of government funds were being spent on education. Some of this money was allocated towards a programme of grants-in-aids that brought secondary education within the reach of many more children. In 1958, the Common Entrance examination was introduced, which offered an unprecedented 2,000 free places in high schools each year (previously, most high-school students were the fee-paying children of the well-to-do, with only a handful of parish scholarships available through which the bright poor could gain access).	107821	In 1960, the existing pension scheme for sugar workers was shut down.

Alternatively, the sample can be tested to see if it utilizes various nutrients in ways characteristic of coliform bacteria.

However, most scholars seem to agree that the Dezhnyov story as we have it is basically correct.

In physical systems, it is present in some meteorological data series, the electromagnetic radiation output of some astronomical bodies, and in almost all electronic devices (referred to as flicker noise ). In biological systems, it is present in, for example, heart beat rhythms, neural activity, and the statistics of DNA sequence s, as a generalized pattern. In financial system s, it is often referred to as a long-term memory effect.	108842	However, it fails to describe the statistical structure of any natural images.

Batman Begins, the biggest project Nolan had undertaken to that point, premiered in June 2005 to critical acclaim and commercial success. Starring Christian Bale in the title role, along with Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson, the film revived the franchise, heralding a trend towards darker films that rebooted (or retold) backstories. It tells the origin story of the character from Bruce Wayne's initial fear of bats, the death of his parents, his journey to become Batman, and his fight against Ra's al Ghul 's plot to destroy Gotham City.	109340	Berated for its psychological depth and contemporary relevance	Praised for its psychological depth and contemporary relevance	2dfaadebe208c7c80094d1f8c25912ba.txt

The multiprogramming work-scheduler scheduler differs from the traditional version in two respects: Its queues are non-blocking. While on dedicated processors, access to the queues can be synchronized using locks, this is not advisable in a multiprogramming environment since the operating system might preempt the worker thread holding the lock, blocking the progress of any other workers that try to access the same queue. Before each attempt to steal work, a worker thread calls a system call that yields the processor on which it is scheduled to the OS, in order to prevent starvation.	109679	Attempts to improve on the multiprogramming work stealer have laid zero focus on cache locality issues	Attempts to improve on the multiprogramming work stealer have focused on cache locality issues	26550b073f90cc55f8ec2b3add58683e.txt

The BFGS method belongs to quasi-Newton methods, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seek a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function. For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero. Newton's method and the BFGS methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.	110732	As expected, BFGS has proven to give terrible performance for non-smooth optimizations.

An Australian teacher built on this to introduce students to a simple model of the weather. In his 1975 Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung und Statistik (Probability and Statistics) volume 2, Engel provided a chip-moving algorithm that could be used to determine the basic descriptive qualities of an absorbing Markov chain.The algorithm depended on recurrence of the initial distribution of chips, which Engel said had been proved by L.

An arbitrage equilibrium is thus a precondition for a general economic equilibrium.The immediate, and formal, extension of this idea, the Fundamental theorem of asset pricing, shows that where markets are as above—and are additionally (implicitly and correspondingly) complete —one may then make financial decisions by constructing a risk neutral probability measure corresponding to the market. Complete here means that there is a price for every asset in every possible state of the world, and that the complete set of possible bets on future states-of-the-world can therefore be constructed with existing assets (assuming no friction ), essentially solving simultaneously for n probabilities, given n prices.	111191	The formal derivation will be proceeding without regard to arbitrage arguments.

Additional die areas are acquired by replacing the complex hardware scheduler with a simple software scheduler. With software scheduling, warps scheduling was moved to Nvidia's compiler and as the GPU math pipeline now has a fixed latency, it now include the utilization of instruction-level parallelism and superscalar execution in addition to thread-level parallelism. As instructions are statically scheduled, scheduling inside a warp becomes redundant since the latency of the math pipeline is already known.	111750	This caused a reduction in die area space and power efficiency.

A quote from FAO, one of the agencies that developed the concept, is useful for defining it: Substantial equivalence embodies the concept that if a new food or food component is found to be substantially equivalent to an existing food or food component, it can be treated in the same manner with respect to safety (i.e., the food or food component can be concluded to be as safe as the conventional food or food component). The concept of substantial equivalence also recognises the fact that existing foods often contain toxic components (usually called antinutrients) and are still able to be consumed safely - in practice there is some tolerable chemical risk taken with all foods, so a comparative method for assessing safety needs to be adopted.	111764	For example, potatoes and tomatoes can possess harmless levels of respectively, solanine and alpha-tomatine alkaloids.

The law protected specified clinics and hospitals ( covered entities ) from drug price increases and gave them access to price reductions. This law requires pharmaceutical manufacturers participating in the Medicaid program to enter into a second agreement with the Secretary of HHS — called a pharmaceutical pricing agreement (PPA) — under which the manufacturer agrees to provide statutorily specified discounts on covered outpatient drugs purchased by government-supported facilities, known as covered entities, that are expected to serve the nation's most vulnerable patient populations.	111989	These discounts is only applicable on purchases of uncovered outpatient drugs.

The time at end of the Cold War offered an unprecedented opportunity to overcome previous economic divisions between the nations on both sides of the Iron Curtain. The clearest prospect for mutually co-dependent beneficial cooperation was the energy sector, given Europe's growing energy demand and vast resource availability in post-Soviet nations.

More broadly, Arthur Wilmarth questioned whether those scandals and the “stock market bubble” of the late-1990s were linked to the growing role of commercial banks in the securities markets during the 1990s. As Wilmarth’s article indicated, the identified bank or bank affiliate activities linked to the Enron and World Com corporate scandals began in 1996 (or earlier) and most occurred before March 11, 2000, when bank holding companies could first use the new securities powers the GLBA provided to “financial holding companies.” In the 1990s investment banks complained that commercial banking firms with Section 20 affiliates had coerced customers into hiring the Section 20 affiliate to underwrite securities in order to receive loans from the affiliated bank, which would have violated the “anti-tying” provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act.	112359	In 1997 the GAO published a report ignoring those claims.

Also, a photonic crystal is not homogeneous, so it is not possible to define values of ε ( permittivity ) or u ( permeability ). While researching whether or not matter interacts with the magnetic component of light, Victor Veselago (1967) envisioned the possibility of refraction with a negative sign, according to Maxwell's equations. A refractive index with a negative sign is the result of permittivity, ε < 0 (less than zero) and magnetic permeability, μ < 0 (less than zero).	112361	Veselago's analysis has been quoted in less than 200 peer reviewed articles and many books.

The BIOS may contain patches to the processor microcode that fix errors in the initial processor microcode; reprogramming is not persistent, thus loading of microcode updates is performed each time the system is powered up. Without reprogrammable microcode, an expensive processor swap would be required; for example, the Pentium FDIV bug became an expensive fiasco for Intel as it required a product recall because the original Pentium processor's defective microcode could not be reprogrammed.

Other historians have disputed the idea that there was a deliberate release of smallpox virus and/or suggest that it arrived with visitors to Australia other than the First Fleet. In 2002, historian Judy Campbell suggested that smallpox had arrived in Australia through contact with fishermen from Makassar in Indonesia, where smallpox was endemic. In 2011, Macknight stated: “The overwhelming probability must be that it [smallpox] was introduced, like the later epidemics, by [Indonesian] trepang ers... and spread across the continent to arrive in Sydney quite independently of the new settlement there.” There is a third theory, that the 1789 epidemic was not smallpox but chickenpox – to which indigenous Australians also had no inherited resistance – that happened to be affecting, or was carried by, members of the First Fleet.	112636	This theory has just received universal acceptance.

I.e., when the thermal diode's first terminal is hotter than the second, heat will flow easily from the first to the second, but when the second terminal is hotter than the first, little heat will flow from the second to the first.Such an effect was first observed in a copper – cuprous-oxide interface by Chauncey Starr in the 1930s.

The combustion of kerosene with hydrogen peroxide is given by the formula CH 2 + 3H 2 O 2 → CO 2 + 4 H 2 Owhere CH 2 is the approximate formula of kerosene (see RP-1 for a discussion of kerosene rocket fuels). This compares with the combustion of kerosene and liquid oxygen (LOX) CH 2 + 1.5O 2 → CO 2 + H 2 Oshowing that the exhaust from kerosene / peroxide is predominantly water.

Although phylogenetic analyses of molecular data on extant animals strongly support the notion that hippopotamids are the closest relatives of cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises), the two groups are unlikely to be closely related when extant and extinct artiodactyls are analyzed.

Partial oxidation (POX) is a type of chemical reaction. It occurs when a substoichiometric fuel-air mixture is partially combusted in a reformer, creating a hydrogen-rich syngas which can then be put to further use, for example in a fuel cell. A distinction is made between thermal partial oxidation (TPOX) and catalytic partial oxidation (CPOX).	112989	Microchannel Reformer Ion transport membrane destroying	Microchannel Reformer Ion transport membrane reforming.	e0c73e03d1f880e1839902ae8de1b3e2.txt

Otherwise, the most a female can be charged with is a serious sexual assault. If a man has sex with someone under the age of 13 then he is also guilty of rape as a child cannot lawfully consent to sex. Of women aged 16 to 59 in England & Wales interviewed for the 2006/07 British Crime Survey, 0.5% (1 in every 200) reported that they had suffered rape or attempted rape in the previous year, equating to approximately 85,000 nationally.	113549	In the same year, more than 1200 persons were chaged with rape.

The US Orbital Segment (USOS) makes use of two separate radio links mounted in the Z1 truss structure: the S band (used for audio) and Ku band (used for audio, video and data) systems. These transmissions are routed via the United States Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) in geostationary orbit, which allows for almost continuous real-time communications with NASA's Mission Control Center (MCC-H) in Houston. Data channels for the Canadarm2, European Columbus laboratory and Japanese Kibō modules are routed via the S band and K u band systems, although the European Data Relay System and a similar Japanese system will eventually complement the TDRSS in this role.	113551	Communications between modules are done in an external digital wireless network.

Nonetheless, a proliferation of multiple small rate centers increases the quantity of wasted numbers as multiple competitive local exchange carrier s each obtain blocks of 10,000 numbers (1000 numbers if number pooling is in effect) in each area code in each of the multiple rate centers in which they plan to offer new service. A new entrant with just a handful of initial subscribers in each rate center will be left with many vacant numbers.

Because it is possible to adjust the size of the inputs to a Feistel network, it is possible to make it very likely that this iteration ends very quickly on average. In the case of credit card numbers, for example, there are 10 16 possible 16-digit credit card numbers, and because the 10 16 = 2 53.1, using a 54-bit wide Feistel network along with cycle walking will create an FPE algorithm that encrypts fairly quickly on average.

This process, known as multiplicity reactivation, has been studied in several bacteriophages, including phage T4. Enzymes employed in recombinational repair in phage T4 are functionally homologous to enzymes employed in bacterial and eukaryotic recombinational repair. In particular, with regard to a gene necessary for the strand exchange reaction, a key step in homologous recombinational repair, there is functional homology from viruses to humans (i. e. uvsX in phage T4; recA in E. coli and other bacteria, and rad51 and dmc1 in yeast and other eukaryotes, including humans).	114376	Multiplicity reactivation has not been seen in numerous pathogenic viruses.

Using the molecular clock method, it was possible to determine the age of the major branches of the orchid family. This also confirmed that the subfamily Vanilloideae is a branch at the basal dichotomy of the monandrous orchids, and must have evolved very early in the evolution of the family. Since this subfamily occurs worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions, from tropical America to tropical Asia, New Guinea and West Africa, and the continents began to split about 100 million years ago, significant biotic exchange must have occurred after this split (since the age of Vanilla is estimated at 60 to 70 million years).	114423	Genome duplication occured well after the divergence of this taxon.

This is most notable (outside of Florida and Hawaii) in Texas, Louisiana, California, Arizona, Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, and coastal North Carolina. In other areas of the country (northern Arkansas, southern Missouri, mountain Tennessee, southern Kansas, the far southern Midwest and along the Ohio river, Kentucky, and Virginia,) containing a climate similar to that of the banana growing region of inland south-central and eastern China ( Sichuan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Hubei, Jiangsu, Henan, Jiangxi, Hunan, Chongqing, and Guizhou provinces,) banana cultivation is more seasonal.

Literature review s by private practitioners who sell bioidentical preparations suggest benefits and advantages in the use of BHRT over its conventional counterpart, but there is significant skepticism over claims made about BHRT; there is no peer-reviewed evidence that compounded bioidentical hormones are safer or more effective than FDA-approved formulations or that they carry less risk. The hormones are expected to carry the same risks as their conventional counterparts, while the risks of including estriol—a hormone normally produced in large amounts only in pregnant women—have not been studied.

Supervisory circuits that specifically focus on voltage regulation are often sold as supply voltage supervisors and will reset the protected circuit when the voltage returns to operating range.Two types of overvoltage protection devices are currently used: clamping, which passes through voltages up to a certain level, and foldback, which shunts voltage away from the load.	115343	The shunting establishes a long circuit which removes power from the protected circuitry.

Even common granite rock with 13 PPM thorium concentration (just twice the crustal average, along with 4 ppm uranium) contains potential nuclear energy equivalent to 50 times the entire rock's mass in coal, although there is no incentive to resort to such very low-grade deposits so long as much higher-grade deposits remain available and cheaper to extract.	115494	Thorium has been formed in shortage of demand from the refining of rare-earth element s.

Sociologist Phil Zuckerman analyzed previous social science research on secularity and non-belief, and concluded that societal well-being is positively correlated with irreligion. He found that there are much lower concentrations of atheism and secularity in poorer, less developed nations (particularly in Africa and South America) than in the richer industrialized democracies. His findings relating specifically to atheism in the US were that compared to religious people in the US, atheists and secular people are less nationalistic, prejudiced, antisemitic, racist, dogmatic, ethnocentric, closed-minded, and authoritarian, and in US states with the highest percentages of atheists, the murder rate is lower than average.	115543	In the most religious states, the murder rate is lower than the mean.

As particular economies move from a manufacturing - to a service-based economy, many more workers in a variety of occupational fields are expected to manage their emotions according to employer demands when compared to sixty years ago. The sociologist Arlie Hochschild provides the first definition of emotional labor, which is a form of emotion regulation that creates a publicly visible facial and bodily display within the workplace. The related term emotion work (also called emotion management ) refers to these same acts done in a private context, such as within the private sphere of one's home or interactions with family and friends.	115993	Hochschild identified four emotion regulation techniques: cognitive, bodily, spiritual, and expressive.

A composite hypothesis holds that early language took the form of part gestural and part vocal mimesis (imitative 'song-and-dance'), combining modalities because all signals (like those of nonhuman apes and monkeys) still needed to be costly in order to be intrinsically convincing.

Areas of mathematics in general are important to this field, such as the study of probabilities and groups. In many ways, physics stems from ancient Greek philosophy. From Thales ' first attempt to characterise matter, to Democritus ' deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant state, the Ptolemaic astronomy of a crystalline firmament, and Aristotle's book Physics (an early book on physics, which attempted to analyze and define motion from a philosophical point of view), various Greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature.	116533	Physics was called an unnatural philosophy until the late 18th century.

The forefront indication a depressive episode is manifesting is the sudden loss of energy or motivation in daily routines. When this occurs, it is not uncommon for individuals to seek medical attention with excessive worrying or anxiety that a more severe, physiological disease may be the underlying issue. However, without an actual disease present, this neurotic thinking often results in severe anxiety, sleep disturbance, and mood swings which may hinder social relationships.	116835	Individuals with endogenous depression will definitely go through inconsistencies in symptom severity	Individuals with endogenous depression may experience inconsistencies in symptom severity	fd48eead93bd73e67318a02e34398fec.txt

The Arabian Plate tectonic origin is grouped into six phases which contributed to its current geology: The early Precambrian (from 800 to 650 Ma) is a compressional phase where a series of islands-arcs and micro-continent terrane accreted to form the oldest portions of the Arabian Plate ( Gondwana ). The development of Hormuz saltbasin was a consequence of the last Precambrian orogenic event. An expanding of polar glaciation in Gondwana occurred in the Late Ordovician, and later sea level rose in the Early Silurian was as a result of the deglaciation which led to extensive deposition of organic-rich shale that corresponds to a maximum flooding surface.	116849	This hot shale is proven to be a minor source of Paleozoic hydrocarbon in Saudi Arabia.

In Service-learning: History, Theory, and Issues, Bruce W. Speck and Sherry Lee Hoppe say that John Dewey's writings on the active nature of understanding and the benefits of and conditions for participatory democracy “provide an early theoretical foundation for a pedagogy in which students cooperatively engage actual social problems”. In Building partnerships for service-learning, Barbara Jacoby writes that Service-learning is based on the work of researchers and theorists on learning, including John Dewey, Jean Piaget, Kurt Lewin, Donald Schon, and David Kolb, who believe that we learn through combinations of action and reflection.” In 1979 Robert Sigmon called for a more precise definition in Service-Learning: Three Principles, in which he said the term, which was relatively new, was being used to describe a number of different volunteer actions and experiential education programs. Sigmon wrote that, in the late 1960s, the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) popularized a service-learning internship model, that defined service-learning as “the integration of the accomplishment of a public task with conscious educational growth.” In 1992 Maryland adopted statewide service-learning requirements for high school graduation.	116924	During the same year, the District of Columbia only adopted such needs.

A fundamental premise of unschooling is that curiosity is innate and that children want to learn. From this an argument can be made that institutionalizing children in a so-called one size fits all or factory model school is an inefficient use of the children's time, because it requires each child to learn specific subject matter in a particular manner, at a particular pace, and at a specific time regardless of that individual's present or future needs, interests, goals, or any pre-existing knowledge he or she might have about the topic.Many unschoolers believe that opportunities for valuable hands-on, community-based, spontaneous, and real-world experiences may be missed when educational opportunities are limited to, or dominated by, those inside a school building.	117360	Unschoolers note that sociologists have documented no differences between children in the way they learn	Unschoolers note that psychologists have documented many differences between children in the way they learn	d2f0a58c28180f81a6797a9eb268709e.txt

A number of judicial decisions gave conflicting interpretations over the characteristics that were definitive of a fixed charge, particularly with reference to charges over book debts (and a fixed charge that did not contain those characteristics would be recharacterised as a floating charge). The position was definitively resolved in NatWest v Spectrum Plus Limited when the House of Lords confirmed that a charge over book debts could be a fixed charge, provided that the secured creditor exhibited the necessary degree of control over the proceeds of the book debts. This would normally require that they either be paid into a blocked account, or that they be paid directly to the secured creditor. Any lesser degree of control was not consistent with a fixed charge, and such charges would be construed as floating charges, regardless of what label the parties had given them.	117383	Floating charges have been praised as a raw deal for unprotected creditor s.

He condemned various interpretations of Marx—such as historicism, idealism, economism—on the grounds that they fail to realise that Marx's science of history, historical materialism, represents a revolutionary view of social change. Althusser believed these errors to result from the notion (mistaken in his view) that Marx's entire body of work forms a coherent whole. Althusser proffered a radical epistemological break in Marx's thought, which can be seen by comparing the unpublished Grundrisse and Das Kapital.	117506	The Grundrisse became available in exactly one language even though a lot of time had passed.

One experiment into the recall strategy of the number of a persons sexual partners has found differences, between the genders.

Furthermore hyperconjugation caused by the extended network draws electrons from the bond to be cleaved, thus weakening the chemical bond and making it labile The sigma bond that is parallel to the pi bond network will break.

In noise, Kosko introduced the concept of adaptive stochastic resonance, using neural-like learning algorithms to find the optimal level of noise to add to many nonlinear systems to improve their performance. He proved many versions of the so-called “forbidden interval theorem,” which guarantees that noise will benefit a system if the average level of noise does not fall in an interval of values.	118433	He also showed that noise would be unable to speed up the convergence of Markov chains to equilibrium.

The habit of dust bathing in domestic hens is probably an attempt by the birds to rid themselves of lice. Lice may transmit microbial diseases and helminth parasites, but most individuals spend their whole life cycle on a single host and are only able to transfer to a new host opportunistically.

Industrial Application- In 1999, Menzel and coworkers developed a synthetic route to obtaining L-Acosamine, the carbohydrate subunit of the anthracycline class of antibiotics center|700px|Acosamine Scheme Industrial Application- An enantioselective aldol addition product can be obtained in asymmetric synthesis by reaction of benzaldehyde with nitromethane and the a catalyst system consisting of a zinc triflate salt / the base diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) and as chiral ligand is the N-methyl derivative of (+)-ephedrine (NME).	118640	A diastereoselective variation of this reaction is missing from below.

Said wrote that Austen was not a neutral writer, but instead a politically charged writer who depicted the world out there as a both a place of no great significance and a place that provided the wealth that supported the Bertram family, which he argued reflected a thoroughly imperialistic understanding of the world. Said stated that because the Bertrams owned their wealth to a slave plantation in Antigua, that Austen wrote the novel to glorify those families who become so rich in the 18th and early 19th centuries thanks to their investments in the sugar plantations of the West Indies.

An initial enantiomeric excess, such as can be produced by polarized light, then allows the more abundant enantiomer to outcompete the other. One supposition is that the discovery of an enantiomeric imbalance in molecules in the Murchison meteorite supports an extraterrestrial origin of homochirality: there is evidence for the existence of circularly polarized light originating from Mie scattering on aligned interstellar dust particles which may trigger the formation of an enantiomeric excess within chiral material in space. Another speculation (the Vester-Ulbricht hypothesis) suggests that fundamental chirality of physical processes such as that of the beta decay (see Parity violation ) leads to slightly different half-lives of biologically relevant molecules.	118964	Homochirality is unable to result from spontaneous absolute asymmetric synthesis.

Phenotypic variation (due to underlying heritable genetic variation ) is a fundamental prerequisite for evolution by natural selection. It is the living organism as a whole that contributes (or not) to the next generation, so natural selection affects the genetic structure of a population indirectly via the contribution of phenotypes.	119091	Without phenotypic variation, there would be rampant evolution by natural selection.

In Negishi coupling, it promotes reaction of alkyl halides, aryl halide s or alkyl sulfonate s with alkylzinc halides, and the important advantage of PEPPSI over alternative catalysts is that the reaction can be carried out in a general chemical laboratory, without a glove box. PEPPSI contains palladium in the +2 oxidation state and is thus a precatalyst, that is the metal must be reduced to the active Pd(0) form in order to enter the cross-coupling catalytic cycle. This is usually achieved in situ in the presence of active transmetalating agents such as organo-magnesium, -zinc, -tin, or -boron reagents.	119127	Once activated, the NHC-Pd(0) species becomes completely immune to air.

Of this amount, about $940 billion (about 6.7 million loans) was, according to Pinto, subprime. Economist Paul Krugman notes the subprime boom was overwhelmingly driven by loan originators who were not subject to the Community Reinvestment Act.

Transactions between Chinese companies and a foreign entity were generally denominated in US dollar s. With Chinese companies unable to hold US dollars and foreign companies unable to hold Chinese yuan, all transactions would go through the People's Bank of China. Once the sum was paid by the foreign party in dollars, the central bank would pass the settlement in renminbi to the Chinese company at the state-controlled exchange rate.In June 2009 the Chinese officials announced a pilot scheme where business and trade transactions were allowed between limited businesses in Guangdong province and Shanghai, and only counterparties in Hong Kong, Macau, and select ASEAN nations.	119336	Failing to prove a success	Proving a success	f12fb964786affd5b0d79439d782dfcf.txt

In 1923, the botanist John Christopher Willis proposed that species were formed by large mutations, not gradual evolution by natural selection, and that evolution was driven by orthogenesis, which he called differentiation, rather than by natural selection. In his 1940 book The Material Basis of Evolution, the German geneticist Richard Goldschmidt argued for single-step speciation by macromutation, describing the organisms thus produced as hopeful monsters. Goldschmidt's thesis was universally rejected and widely ridiculed by biologists, who favoured the neo-Darwinian explanations of Fisher, J. B. S.

For byte-aligned data, Adler-32 is faster than a properly implemented Fletcher's checksum (e.g., one found in the Hierarchical Data Format ). In C, an inefficient but straightforward implementation is : const uint32_t MOD_ADLER = 65521;uint32_t adler32(unsigned char *data, size_t len) /* where data is the location of the data in physical memory and len is the length of the data in bytes */{ uint32_t a = 1, b = 0; size_t index; // Process each byte of the data in order for (index = 0; index < len; ++index) { a = (a + data[index]) % MOD_ADLER; b = (b + a) % MOD_ADLER; } return (b << 16) | a;} See the zlib source code for a more efficient implementation that requires a fetch and two additions per byte, with the modulo operations deferred with two remainders computed every several thousand bytes.

Individual acts of indirect reciprocity may be classified as upstream or downstream : Upstream reciprocity occurs when an act of altruism causes the recipient to perform a later act of altruism in the benefit of a third party. In other words: A helps B, which then motivates B to help C. Downstream reciprocity occurs when the performer of an act of altruism is more likely to be the recipient of a later act of altruism. In other words: A helps B, making it more likely that C will later help A.

The prosecution offered Brenneke a deal that would keep him out of prison if he pleaded guilty; he refused. The prosecution produced a CIA personnel specialist who testified that he could not find Brenneke or Rupp in the Agency's employment records, but under cross-examination admitted that Rupp had been trained by the CIA's Intermountain Aviation, and that the Agency had files on both Rupp and Brenneke.

The way a sound changes over time (see figure 4) provides most of the information for timbre identification. Even though a small section of the wave form from each instrument looks very similar (see the expanded sections indicated by the orange arrows in figure 4), differences in changes over time between the clarinet and the piano are evident in both loudness and harmonic content.

22277	http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/baluchistan.pdf	The source of irrigation water in these cases often is groundwater from aquifer s. However, the exploitation of aquifers can also be combined with surface irrigation at field level. In relatively small areas one applies subirrigation whereby the water infiltrates into the soil below the soil surface from pipes or ditches. This category includes tidal irrigation used in the lower part of rivers where the tidal influence is felt by permitting the river water to enter ditches at high tide and allowing it to infiltrate from there into the soil In relative rare cases one uses labor-intensive methods like irrigation with watering-cans and by filling dug-in porous pots (pitcher irrigation) from where the water enters the soil by capillary suction.Surface irrigation can be divided into the following types, based on the method by which water is spread over the field after it has been admitted through the inlet: spate irrigation (in Pakistan called Rod Koh ), which may occur in hilly regions in dry zones where small rivers produce spate floods; ditches and bunds are built to guide the water to the fields to be irrigated; the number of fields irrigated at each flood event depends on the duration and intensity of the flood.	119604	The sailaba system in Balochistan is an exemption to this 	The sailaba system in Balochistan is an example	6fd2083ded787642172bb83ef65de258.txt

This is clearly the case, since otherwise the verifier could record the execution of the protocol and replay it to someone else: if this were accepted by the new party as proof that the replaying party knows the secret information, then the new party's acceptance is either justified—the replayer does know the secret information—which means that the protocol leaks knowledge and is not zero-knowledge, or it is spurious—i.e. leads to a party accepting someone's proof of knowledge who does not actually possess it.	119798	All forms of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge are only imaginary	Some forms of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge exist	01d725a56e1732e428f5989aedfbfa22.txt

He emphasizes that scientists must consider the economics of the materials they propose to use for energy sources and for storage technologies, if they are to develop viable energy alternatives. Nocera's early work on two-electron bonds and multielectron exited states is considered to have established new paradigms in excited-state chemistry. The idea behind two-electron mixed-valency is that single-electron mixed-valence compounds and two-electron mixed-valence compounds may be analogous: single-electron mixed-valence compounds may react in one-electron steps, while two-electron mixed-valence compounds may react in two-electron steps.	120084	Further, a two-electron bond is unable to be predicted to give rise to four multielectronic states.

Some attempts have been made to model these temporal logics using both computational formalisms such as the Event Calculus and temporal logics such as defeasible temporal logic. In any consideration of the use of logic to model law it needs to be borne in mind that law is inherently non-monotonic, as is shown by the rights of appeal enshrined in all legal systems, and the way in which interpretations of the law change over time.

In addition, many Israeli settlements have been established on sites that were home to Jewish communities before 1948 such as Neve Yaakov, Gush Etzion, Hebron, Kalia, and Kfar Darom.Contrary to this view other legal scholars have argued that under Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties the only common sense interpretation of UNSC 242 is that Israel must withdraw from all of the territory captured in 1967, as any interpretation permitting the extension of sovereignty by conquest would violate the relevant governing principle of international law as emphasized in the preambular statement, i.e., the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war as established through the abolition of the right of conquest by the League of Nations following World War I.Furthermore, it is argued that UNSC 242 has binding force under Article 25 of the UN Charter owing to its incorporation into UN Security Council Resolution 338 and that it is also binding on Israel and the PLO by agreement owing to its incorporation into the Oslo Accords.	120127	Everyone argues that the Oslo Accords fail to supersede UNSC 242, rather making it binding.

The brothers had earlier misled the inhabitants of Shechem by consenting to Dinah's rapist marrying her, and when Jacob hears about their destruction of Shechem, he castigates them for it. In the Blessing of Jacob, Jacob is described as imposing a curse on the Levites, by which they would be scattered, in punishment for Levi's actions in Shechem. Some textual scholars date the Blessing of Jacob to a period between just one and two centuries prior to the Babylonian captivity, and some Biblical scholars regard this curse, and Dinah herself as an aetiological postdiction to explain the fates of the tribe of Simeon and the Levites, with one possible explanation of the Levites' scattered nature being that the priesthood was originally open to any tribe, but gradually became seen as a distinct tribe itself (the Levites).	120286	Nevertheless, Isaac, Levi's grandfather, fail to give a special blessing about the lineage of priests of God.

The Egyptian “chevrons” are active, wind-generated dunes, but the “chevrons” in the Bahamas are inactive and have been variously interpreted.

This leads to an increased heart rate ( tachycardia ), rapid breathing ( hyperventilation ) which may be perceived as shortness of breath ( dyspnea ), and sweating. Because strenuous activity rarely ensues, the hyperventilation leads to a drop in carbon dioxide levels in the lung s and then in the blood. This leads to shifts in blood pH ( respiratory alkalosis or hypocapnia ), causing compensatory metabolic acidosis activating chemosensing mechanisms which translate this pH shift into autonomic and respiratory responses.	120695	The person him/herself would never overlook the hyperventilation, having become preoccupied with the associated somatic symptoms.

It is most famous for being the habitat for the endangered black robin, rescued from near extinction by a dedicated team led by Don Merton, who used foster parent birds to raise the chicks of black robin. The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it supports large breeding colonies of broad-billed prion s (330,000 pairs), Chatham petrel s (up to 1000 pairs) and white-faced storm petrel s (840,000 pairs). Rangatira was the stronghold, and last remaining breeding site for the Chatham petrel until recently; new colonies on Pitt and Chatham Islands are being established.	121177	For a 1990 report of the birdlife of Rangatira, see Nilsson et al.

The mass-spring model (obtained from a polygonal mesh representation of the cloth) determines the internal spring forces acting on the nodes at each timestep (in combination with gravity and applied forces). Newton's second law gives equations of motion which can be solved via standard ODE solvers. To create high resolution cloth with a realistic stiffness is not possible however with simple explicit solvers (such as forward Euler integration ), unless the timestep is made too small for interactive applications (since as is well known, explicit integrators are numerically unstable for sufficiently stiff systems).	121201	Henceforth, explicit solvers must be used	Therefore, implicit solvers must be used	cc62c1b253c196895128af8b2af3bbab.txt

Every time the master oscillator's cycle repeats, the slave is retriggered, regardless of its position. If the slave is tuned to a lower frequency than the master it will be forced to repeat before it completes an entire cycle, and if it is tuned to a higher frequency it will be forced to repeat partway through a second or third cycle. This technique ensures that the oscillators are technically playing at the same frequency, but the irregular cycle of the slave oscillator often causes complex timbres and the impression of harmony.	121532	Even if the tuning of the slave oscillator is swept, one would still be unable to discern a harmonic sequence	If the tuning of the slave oscillator is swept, one may discern a harmonic sequence	f9d906fb4f0040c745b073a038fc6d99.txt

However, it should also be noted that high levels of aldosterone have been associated with adverse bone changes, and so the antimineralocorticoid activity of spironolactone might partially or fully be responsible for these effects as a potential alternative explanation. In addition to direct interaction with the ER, spironolactone also has some indirect estrogenic activity, which it mediates via several actions, including: By acting as an antiandrogen, as androgens can suppress both estrogen production and signaling (e.g., in the breasts).

The only way to avoid catastrophic failures is to limit the current which can flow from the source in order to reduce the breakdown to a limited area. Current flowing through the crystallized area causes heating in the manganese dioxide cathode near the fault. At increased temperatures a chemical reaction then reduces the surrounding conductive manganese dioxide to the insulating manganese(III) oxide (Mn 2 O 3 ) and insulates the crystallized oxide in the tantalum oxide layer, stopping local current flow.	122171	Solid tantalum capacitors with crystallization have the smallest chances of failure at power-on.

For high-dimensional datasets (i.e. with number of dimensions more than 10), dimension reduction is usually performed prior to applying a K-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) in order to avoid the effects of the curse of dimensionality. Feature extraction and dimension reduction can be combined in one step using principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), or canonical correlation analysis (CCA) techniques as a pre-processing step followed by clustering by K-NN on feature vectors in reduced-dimension space.	122253	In machine learning this process is also back-propogation.

(The Fabian Commission had in fact called for a directly hypothecated NHS tax to cover the full cost of NHS spending, arguing that linking taxation more directly to spending was essential to make tax rise publicly acceptable. The 2001 National Insurance rise was not formally hypothecated, but the government committed itself to using the additional funds for health spending.)

Current research shows that this may be due to external factors other than the willingness or need to participate. Research shows that children that come from high-socioeconomic households typically do not participate in after-school programs because they are already involved in a wide range of other activities not funded by the school. Children that come from low-socioeconomic households, however, typically do not participate because of a lack of ability to participate.	122749	Availability of transportation is another deterrant to utilizing play spaces and after-school programs.

But he argues that after decades during which very little progress has been made in reducing carbon emissions, we must put climate engineering on the table and consider it responsibly....This book provides a clear and accessible overview of the costs and risks, and how climate engineering might fit into a larger program for managing climate change.” He has also contributed to assessments focused on geoengineering.	122962	Keith served as a member of the working group for UK Royal Society's 2008 report	Keith was a member of the working group for UK Royal Society's 2009 report	7e019809e97863a3d0ca77b7e6121113.txt

However, the evidence suggests that economic growth does not always benefit each part of the population equally. For example, the 1980s was a period of economic growth and prosperity in the United States, but most of the economic gains were concentrated at the top of the income spectrum. This means that people near the bottom of the labor market did not benefit from the economic gains of the 1980s.	123017	In fact, many have discussed that low-skilled workers experienced rising prosperity in the 1980s.

Also, according to the psychoanalytic theory, there are five stages of psycho-sexual development that everyone goes through: the oral stage, anal stage, phallic stage, latency stage, and genital stage. Mental disorders can be caused by an individual receiving too little or too much gratification in one of the psycho-sexual developmental stages.	123018	When this occurs, the individual is said to be varying in that developmental stage.

However, since it also shared similarities with other Western Indo-European branches (particularly Celtic languages and Germanic languages ), some linguists prefer to consider it an independent Indo-European language. Venetic may also have been related to the Illyrian languages once spoken in the western Balkans, though the theory that Illyrian and Venetic were closely related is debated by current scholarship.Some important parallels with the Germanic languages have also been noted, especially in pronominal forms: Venetic: ego = I, accusative mego = me Gothic: ik, accusative mik (Latin: ego, accusative me ) Venetic: sselboi sselboi = to oneself Old High German : selb selbo (Latin: sibi ipsi )A recent research found out that Venetic was a relatively archaic language significantly similar to Celtic, on the basis of morphology, while it occupied an intermediate position between Celtic and Italic, on the phonological side, but the similarities with the latter may well have arisen as areal phenomena.	123173	Only phonological differences to Rhaetian have also been pointed out.

Although the partition problem is NP-complete, there is a pseudo-polynomial time dynamic programming solution, and there are heuristics that solve the problem in many instances, either optimally or approximately. For this reason, it has been called the easiest NP-hard problem. There is an optimization version of the partition problem, which is to partition the multiset S into two subsets S 1, S 2 such that the difference between the sum of elements in S 1 and the sum of elements in S 2 is minimized.	124002	The optimization version is not NP-hard, and can be solved efficiently in practice.

23243	http://philpapers.org/archive/KAPGOM.pdf	Gould maintains that their book contains no new arguments and presentsno compelling data; it merely refashions earlier arguments for biological determinism, which Gould defines as the abstraction of intelligence as a single entity, its location within the brain, its quantification as one number for each individual, and the use of these numbers to rank people in a single series of worthiness, invariably to find that oppressed and disadvantaged groups—races, classes, or sexes—are innately inferior and deserve their status. The Mismeasure of Man is a critical analysis of the early works of scientific racism which promoted the theory ofunitary, innate, linearly rankable intelligence —such as craniometry, the measurement of skull volume and its relation to intellectual faculties. Gould alleged that much of the research was based largely on racial and social prejudices of the researchers rather than their scientific objectivity; that on occasion, researchers such as Samuel George Morton (1799–1851), Louis Agassiz (1807–1873), and Paul Broca (1824–1880), committed the methodological fallacy of allowing their personal a priori expectations to influence their conclusions and analytical reasoning. Gould noted that when Morton switched from using bird seed, which was less reliable, to lead shot to obtain endocranial-volume data, the average skull volumes changed, however these changes were not uniform across Morton's racial groupings.	124241	To Gould, it was observable that unconscious bias did not affect Morton's initial results.

It was soon determined that the basis for this food chain is a form of bacterium that derives its energy from oxidation of reactive chemicals, such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide, that bubble up from the Earth's interior. This chemosynthesis revolutionized the study of biology by revealing that terrestrial life need not be Sun-dependent; it only requires water and an energy gradient in order to exist.It is now known that extremophiles, microorganisms with extraordinary capability to thrive in the harshest environments on Earth, can specialize to thrive in the deep-sea, ice, boiling water, acid, the water core of nuclear reactors, salt crystals, toxic waste and in a range of other extreme habitats that were previously thought to be inhospitable for life. Living bacteria found in ice core samples retrieved from deep at Lake Vostok in Antarctica, have provided data for extrapolations to the likelihood of microorganisms surviving frozen in extraterrestrial habitats or during interplanetary transport.	124303	Additionally, bacteria have been found dead within warm rock deep in the Earth's crust.

Until the mid-1980s Formula One engines were limited to around 12,000 rpm due to the traditional metal valve springs used to close the valves. The speed required to operate the engine valves at a higher rpm called for ever stiffer springs, which increased the power loss to drive the camshaft and the valves to the point where the loss nearly offset the power gain through the increase in rpm.	124341	They replaced pneumatic valve springs introduced by Arnault	They were replaced by pneumatic valve springs introduced by Renault	1862236d8cf522e12b8d29d5d7eb4e5b.txt

They reside in what would normally be the air gap around the voice coil, held in place by the speaker's magnet. Since ferrofluids are paramagnetic, they obey Curie's law and thus become less magnetic at higher temperatures. A strong magnet placed near the voice coil (which produces heat) will attract cold ferrofluid more than hot ferrofluid thus forcing the heated ferrofluid away from the electric voice coil and toward a heat sink.	124388	This is a comparatively efficient cooling technique which needs additional energy input.

This is an important distinction to make as whilst the partition coefficient has a fixed value for the partitioning of a solute between two phases, the distribution ratio changes with differing conditions in the solvent.

Indeed, Japanese have tended to score comparatively poorly on international tests of English. Secondly, English is frequently used in Japan for aesthetic rather than functional purposes; i.e., for Japanese consumption, not for English speakers per se, as a way of appearing smart, sophisticated and modern, in much the same way as Japanese and similar writing scripts are used in Western fashion.

Upon being mixed with shale or marl, and roasted, the sulfate liberates sulfur trioxide gas, a precursor in sulfuric acid production, the reaction also produces calcium silicate, a mineral phase essential in cement clinker production. CaSO 4 + SiO 2 → CaSiO 3 + SO 3 When sold at the anhydrous state as a desiccant with a color-indicating agent under the name Drierite, it appears blue (anhydrous) or pink (hydrated) due to impregnation with cobalt(II) chloride, which functions as a moisture indicator.

The development of trade must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union. In its judgment in the case of Altmark Trans GmbH and Regierungsprasidium Magdeburg v. Nahverkehrsgesellschaft Altmark GmbH (generally referred to as 'Altmark'), the Court of Justice of the European Union held that public sector compensation does not constitute State Aid if the following four criteria are all met: The organisation receiving funds (compensation) must actually have public service obligations to discharge, and the obligations must be clearly defined; The parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner; The compensation must not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in the discharge of the public sector obligations, taking into account the relevant receipts and a reasonable profit; Either, The undertaking which is to discharge the public service obligations must have been chosen pursuant to a public procurement procedure which would allow for the selection of the bidder capable of providing the services at the least cost to the community; or The level of compensation needed must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped, would have incurred.	124943	The European Commission has refused to state	The European Commission has stated	3a2e1ef2b976d046c2643249f6705496.txt

Cavitation bubbles, when near a solid surface, can also become a torus. The area away from the surface has an increased static pressure causing a high pressure jet to develop. This jet is directed towards the solid surface and breaks through the bubble to form a torus shaped bubble for a short period of time.	125464	This creates singular shock waves that can help the surface.

At least three other Erysiphaceae fungi can cause powdery mildew in cucurbits: The most frequent, after P. xanthii, is Erysiphe cichoracearum, the former primary causal organism throughout most of the world.

Other designs include a longer helical (spiral) track, or a large ring design whereby a space vehicle would circle the ring numerous times, gradually gaining speed, before being released into a launch corridor leading skyward. Nevertheless, if technically feasible and cost effective to build, imparting hyper-velocity escape velocity to a projectile launching at sea level, where the atmosphere is the most dense, may result in much of the launch velocity being lost to aerodynamic drag. In addition, the projectile might still require some form of on-board guidance and control to realize a useful orbital insertion angle that may not be achievable based simply on the launcher's upward elevation angle relative to the surface of the earth, (see practical considerations of escape velocity ).	125926	In 2003, Ian McNab failed to form a plan to turn this idea into a realized technology.

In fact the problem can arise in almost any context where one party is being paid by another to do something where the agent has a small or nonexistent share in the outcome, whether in formal employment or a negotiated deal such as paying for household jobs or car repairs.The problem arises where the two parties have different interests and asymmetric information (the agent having more information), such that the principal cannot directly ensure that the agent is always acting in their (the principal's) best interest, particularly when activities that are useful to the principal are costly to the agent, and where elements of what the agent does are costly for the principal to observe (see moral hazard and conflict of interest ). Often, the principal may be sufficiently concerned at the possibility of being exploited by the agent that they choose not to enter into the transaction at all, when it would have been mutually beneficial: a suboptimal outcome that can lower welfare overall.	126400	The deviation from the principal's interest by the agent is named agency expenses.

The perpetuation of these laws not only limits farm size but also bars women from ownership or inheritance. Furthermore, as small farmers face the increasing competition with larger farm operations an increasing number of men migrate to city centers for higher wages and employment.

A mesoscale convective system's overall cloud and precipitation pattern may be round or linear in shape, and include weather systems such as tropical cyclone s, squall line s, lake-effect snow events, polar low s, and Mesoscale Convective Complex es (MCCs), and they generally form near weather front s. Most mesoscale convective systems develop overnight and continue their lifespan through the next day. The type that forms during the warm season over land has been noted across North America, Europe, and Asia, with a maximum in activity noted during the late afternoon and evening hours. Forms of MCS that develop in the tropics are found in use either the Intertropical Convergence Zone or monsoon trough s, generally within the warm season between spring and fall.	126752	More intense systems form over sea than over land.

23819	http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/801509.pdf	Used typically in rifled small arms (SLAP, shotguns and muzzleloaders), an expanding cup sabot has a one piece sabot surrounding the base and sides of a projectile, providing both structural support and obturation. Upon firing, when the sabot and projectile leave the muzzle of the gun, inertia from the rotation of the projectile, due to barrel rifling, opens up the segments surrounding the projectile, rapidly presenting more surface area to air pressure, quickly releasing it.Although the use of cup sabots of various complexity are popular with rifle ammunition hand-loaders, in order to achieve significantly higher muzzle velocity with a lower drag, smaller diameter and lighter bullet, successful saboted projectile design has to include the resulting bullet stability characteristics. For example, simply inserting a commercially available 5.56mm (.224) bullet into a sabot that will fire it from a commercially available 7.62mm (.300) barrel may result in that 5.56mm bullet failing to achieve sufficient gyroscopic stability to fly accurately without tumbling.	126956	To achieve gyroscopic stability of longer bullets in smaller diameter requires slower rifling.

The heavier quarks rapidly change into up and down quarks through a process of particle decay : the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Because of this, up and down quarks are generally stable and the most common in the universe, whereas strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks can only be produced in high energy collisions (such as those involving cosmic ray s and in particle accelerator s). For every quark flavor there is a corresponding type of antiparticle, known as an antiquark, that differs from the quark only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign.	127560	The quark model was jointly proposed by physicists Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964.

The study evaluated the degree to which toxic products were released, looking at toxicity, time-release profiles, and lethality of doses released, in a range of flaming, non-flaming, and poorly ventilated fires, and concluded that PIR generally released a considerably higher level of toxic products than the other insulating materials studied (PIR > PUR > EPS > PHF; glass and stone wools also studied). In particular, hydrogen cyanide is recognised as a significant contributor to the fire toxicity of PIR (and PUR) foams.	127580	Despite this PIR insulation is generally regarded as being less fire resistant than PUR insulation.

OSTE+ allows for soft lithography microstructuring, strong biocompatible dry bonding to almost any substrate during Lab-on-a-chip (LoC) manufacturing, while simultaneously mimicking the mechanical properties found in thermoplastic polymers, hence allowing for true prototyping of commercial LoC. The commonly used materials for microfluidics suffer from unwieldy steps and often ineffective bonding processes, especially when packaging biofunctionalized surfaces, which makes LoC assembly difficult and costly OSTE+ polymer which effectively bonds to nine dissimilar types of substrates, requires no surface treatment prior to the bonding at room temperature, features high Tg, and achieves good bonding strength to at least 100 °C.

Sukhoi's patent of the Su-57's stealth features cites an average RCS of the aircraft of approximately 0.1-1 square meters. However, like other stealth fighters, the Su-57's low observability measures are chiefly effective against high frequency (between 3 and 30 GHz ) radars, usually found on other aircraft. The effects of Rayleigh scattering and resonance mean that low-frequency radar s, employed by weather radar s and early-warning radar s are more likely to detect the Su-57 due to its physical size.	127778	However, such radars are also tiny, susceptible to clutter, and are, in fact, more precise.

However, for a special class of automata in which all state transitions preserve the cyclic order of the states, he describes a different algorithm with time O( kn 2 ) that always finds the shortest synchronizing word, proves that these automata always have a synchronizing word of length at most ( n − 1) 2 (the bound given in Černý's conjecture), and exhibits examples of automata with this special form whose shortest synchronizing word has length exactly ( n − 1) 2. The road coloring problem is the problem of labeling the edges of a regular directed graph with the symbols of a k -letter input alphabet (where k is the outdegree of each vertex) in order to form a synchronizable DFA.

Research has shown that individuals who reported high jealousy scores had more stable and successful relationships than individuals who reported comparatively low jealousy scores. Furthermore, individuals in committed relationships tend to experience higher levels of jealousy than individuals in less committed relationships. To explain this, researchers have proposed that those in better quality, more committed relationships would have more to lose if their partner were to leave them for someone else, and therefore worry more about infidelity.	128574	Therefore, such individuals experience less sexual jealousy if they feel the relationship is threatened.

Hence, the relationship between the syntonic temperament and its note-aligned timbres can be seen as a generalization of the special relationship between Just Intonation and the Harmonic Series.Maintaining a constant mapping between notes and partials, across the entire tuning range, enables Dynamic tonality, which includes timbre effects such as primeness, conicality, and richness, and tonal effects such as polyphonic tuning bends and dynamic tuning progressions. If one considers the syntonic temperament's tuning continuum as a string, and individual tunings as beads on that string, then one can view much of the traditional microtonal literature as being focused the differences among the beads, whereas the syntonic temperament can be viewed as being focused on the commonality along the string.	128676	The notes of the syntonic temperament are worst played using the Wicki-Hayden note layout.

In law, registered partnerships and marriage convey the same rights and duties, especially after some laws were changed to remedy inequalities with respect to inheritance and some other issues. Unregistered partnerships or informal cohabitation is when same-sex or opposite-sex couples live together as a couple but they choose to keep the legal status of their relationship unregistered or informal.
